# 13-A-comedy-of-errors-Debugging-Java-memory-leaks

We all make errors, but some errors seem so ridiculous we wonder how anyone, let alone we ourselves, could have done such a thing. This is, of course, easy to notice only after the fact. Below, I describe a series of such errors which we recently made in one of our applications. What makes it interesting is that initial symptoms indicated a completely different kind of problem than the one actually present.

人人都会犯错，但一些错误是如此的荒谬，我想不通怎么会有人犯这种错误。更没想到的是，这种事竟发生在了我们身上。当然，这种东西只有事后才能发现真相。接下来，我将讲述一系列最近在我们一个应用上犯过的这种错误。最有意思的是，一开始的迹象揭示的问题，与实际发生的问题完全不同。

## Once upon a midnight dreary
## 在一个凄凉的午夜

I was woken up shortly after midnight by an alert from our monitoring system. Adventory, an application responsible for indexing ads in our [PPC (pay-per-click) advertising system](https://ads.allegro.pl/) had apparently restarted several times in a row. In a cloud environment, a restart of one single instance is a normal event and does not trigger any alerts, but this time the threshold had been exceeded by multiple instances restarting within a short period. I switched on my laptop and dived into the application’s logs.
午夜刚过，我就被一条来自监控系统的警报吵醒了。Adventory，我们的 [PPC （以点击次数收费）广告系统](https://ads.allegro.pl/)中一个负责索引广告的应用，很明显连续重启了好几次。在云端的环境里，实例的重启是很正常的，也不会触发报警，但这次实例重启的次数在短时间内超过了阈值。我打开了笔记本电脑，一头扎进项目的日志里。

## It must be the network
## 一定是网络的问题

I saw several timeouts as the service attempted connecting to [ZooKeeper](https://zookeeper.apache.org/). We use ZooKeeper (ZK) to coordinate indexing between multiple instances and rely on it to be robust. Clearly, a Zookeeper failure would prevent indexing from succeeding, but it shouldn’t cause the whole app to die. Still, this was such a rare situation (the first time I ever saw ZK go down in production) that I thought maybe we had indeed failed to handle this case gracefully. I woke up the on-duty person responsible for ZooKeeper and asked them to check what was going on.
我看到服务在连接 [ZooKeeper](https://zookeeper.apache.org/) 时发生了数次超时。我们使用 ZooKeeper（ZK）协调多个实例间的索引操作，并依赖它实现鲁棒性。很显然，一次 Zookeeper 失败会阻止索引操作的继续运行，不过它应该不会导致整个系统挂掉。而且，这种情况非常罕见（这是我第一次遇到 ZK 在生产环境挂掉），我觉得这个问题可能不太容易搞定。于是我把 ZooKeeper 的值班人员喊醒了，让他们看看发生了什么。

Meanwhile, I checked our configuration and realized that timeouts for ZooKeeper connections were in the multi-second range. Obviously, ZooKeeper was completely dead, and given that other applications were also using it, this meant serious trouble. I sent messages to a few more teams who were apparently not aware of the issue yet.

同时，我检查了我们的配置，发现 ZooKeeper 连接的超时时间是秒级的。很明显，ZooKeeper 全挂了，由于其他服务也在使用它，这意味着问题非常严重。我给其他几个团队发了消息，他们显然还不知道这事儿。

My colleague from ZooKeeper team got back to me, saying that everything looked perfectly normal from his point of view. Since other users seemed unaffected, I slowly realized ZooKeeper was not to blame. Logs clearly showed network timeouts, so I woke up the people responsible for networking.

ZooKeeper 团队的同事回复我了，在他看来，系统运行一切正常。由于其他用户看起来没有受到影响，我慢慢意识到不是 ZooKeeper 的问题。日志里明显是网络超时，于是我把负责网络的同事叫醒了。

Networking team checked their metrics but found nothing of interest. While it is possible for a single segment of the network or even a single rack to get cut off from the rest, they checked the particular hosts on which my app instances were running and found no issues. I had checked a few side ideas in the meantime but none worked, and I was at my wit’s end. It was getting really late (or rather early) and, independently from my actions, restarts somehow became less frequent. Since this app only affected the freshness of data but not its availability, together with all involved we decided to let the issue wait until morning.

负责网络的团队检查了他们的监控，没有发现任何异常。由于单个网段，甚至单个节点，都有可能和剩余的其他节点断开连接，他们检查了我们系统实例所在的几台机器，没有发现异常。其间，我尝试了其他几种思路，不过都行不通，我也到了自己智力的极限。时间已经很晚了（或者说很早了），同时，跟我的尝试没有任何关系，重启变得不那么频繁了。由于这个服务仅仅负责数据的刷新，并不会影响到数据的可用性，我们决定把问题放到上午再说。

## It must be garbage collection
## 一定是 GC 的问题

Sometimes it is a good idea to sleep on it and get back to a tough problem with a fresh mind. Nobody understood what was going on and the service behaved in a really magical way. Then it dawned on me. What is the main source of magic in Java applications? Garbage collection of course.
有时候把难题放一放，睡一觉，等脑子清醒了再去解决是一个好主意。没人知道当时发生了什么，服务表现的非常怪异。突然间，我想到了什么。Java 服务表现怪异的主要根源是什么？当然是垃圾回收。

Just for cases like this, we keep GC logging on by default. I quickly downloaded the GC log and fired up [Censum](https://www.jclarity.com/censum/). Before my very eyes, a grisly sight opened: full garbage collections happening once every 15 minutes and causing 20-second long [!] stop-the-world pauses. No wonder the connection to ZooKeeper was timing out despite no issues with either ZooKeeper or the network!
为了应对目前这种情况的发生，我们一直打印着 GC 的日志。我马上把 GC 日志下载了下来，然后打开 [Censum](https://www.jclarity.com/censum/) 开始分析日志。我还没仔细看，就发现了一个恐怖的情况：每15分钟发生一次 full GC，每次 GC 引发长达 20 秒的服务停顿。怪不得连接 ZooKeeper 超时了，即使 ZooKeeper 和网络都没有问题。

These pauses also explained why the whole application kept dying rather than just timing out and logging an error. Our apps run inside [Marathon](https://mesosphere.github.io/marathon/), which regularly polls a healthcheck endpoint of each instance and if the endpoint isn’t responding within reasonable time, Marathon restarts that instance.
这些停顿也解释了为什么整个服务一直是死掉的，而不是超时之后只打一条错误日志。我们的服务运行在 [Marathon](https://mesosphere.github.io/marathon/) 上，它定时检查每个实例的健康状态，如果某个端点在一段时间内没有响应，Marathon 就重启那个服务。

![20-second GC pauses — certainly not your average GC log](https://allegro.tech/img/articles/2018-02-09-a-comedy-of-errors-debugging-java-memory-leaks/adventory-gc-pause-20-s.png)

Knowing the cause of a problem is half the battle, so I was very confident that the issue would be solved in no time. In order to explain my further reasoning, I have to say a bit more about how Adventory works, for it is not your standard microservice.

知道原因之后，问题就解决一半了，因此我相信这个问题很快就能解决。为了解释后面的推理，我需要说明一下 Adventory 是如何工作的，它不像你们那种标准的微服务。

Adventory is used for indexing our ads into [ElasticSearch (ES)](https://www.elastic.co/). There are two sides to this story. One is acquiring the necessary data. To this end, the app receives events sent from several other parts of the system via [Hermes](http://hermes.allegro.tech/). The data is saved to [MongoDB](http://mongodb.org/) collections. The traffic is a few hundred requests per second at most, and each operation is rather lightweight, so even though it certainly causes some memory allocation, it doesn’t require lots of resources. The other side of the story is indexing itself. This process is started periodically (around once every two minutes) and causes data from all the different MongoDB collections to be streamed using [RxJava](https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxJava), combined into denormalized records, and sent to ElasticSearch. This part of the application resembles an offline batch processing job more than a service.

Adventory 是用来把我们的广告索引到 [ElasticSearch (ES)](https://www.elastic.co/) 的。这需要两个步骤。第一步是获取所需的数据。到目前为止，这个服务从其他几个系统中接收通过 [Hermes](http://hermes.allegro.tech/) 发来的事件。数据保存到 [MongoDB](http://mongodb.org/) 集群中。数据量最多每秒几百个请求，每个操作都特别轻量，因此即便触发一些内存的回收，也耗费不了多少资源。第二步就是数据的索引。这个操作定时执行（大概两分钟执行一次），把所有 MongoDB 集群存储的数据通过 [RxJava](https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxJava) 收集到一个流中，组合为非范式的记录，发送给 ElasticSearch。这部分操作类似离线的批处理任务，而不是一个服务。

During each run, the whole index is rebuilt since there are usually so many changes to the data that incremental indexing is not worth the fuss. This means that a whole lot of data has to pass through the system and that a lot of memory allocation takes place, forcing us to use a heap as large as 12 GB despite using streams. Due to the large heap (and to being the one which is currently fully supported), our GC of choice was G1.
由于经常需要对数据做大量的更新，维护索引就不太值得，所以每执行一次定时任务，整个索引都会重建一次。这意味着一整块数据都要经过这个系统，从而引发大量的内存回收。尽管使用了流的方式，我们也被迫把堆加到了 12 GB 这么大。由于堆是如此巨大（而且目前被全力支持），我们的 GC 选择了 G1。

Having previously worked with some applications which allocate a lot of short-lived objects, I increased the size of young generation by increasing both `-XX:G1NewSizePercent` and `-XX:G1MaxNewSizePercent` from their default values so that more data could be handled by the young GC rather than being moved to old generation, as Censum showed a lot of premature tenuring. This was also consistent with the full GC collections taking place after some time. Unfortunately, these settings didn’t help one bit.
我以前处理过的服务中，也会回收大量生命周期很短的对象。有了那些经验，我同时增加了 `-XX:G1NewSizePercent` 和 `-XX:G1MaxNewSizePercent` 的默认值，这样新生代会变得更大，young GC 就可以处理更多的数据，而不用把它们送到老年代。Censum 也显示有很多过早提升。这和一段时间之后发生的 full GC 也是一致的。不幸的是，这些设置没有起到任何作用。

The next thing I thought was that perhaps the producer generated data too fast for the consumer to consume, thus causing records to be allocated faster than they could be freed. I tried to reduce the speed at which data was produced by the repository by decreasing the size of a thread pool responsible for generating the denormalized records while keeping the size of the consumer data pool which sent them off to ES unchanged. This was a primitive attempt at applying [backpressure](http://reactivex.io/documentation/operators/backpressure.html), but it didn’t help either.
接下来我想，或许生产者制造数据太快了，消费者来不及消费，导致这些记录在它们被处理前就被回收了。我尝试减小生产数据的线程数量，降低数据产生的速度，同时保持消费者发送给 ES 的数据池大小不变。这主要是使用[背压](http://reactivex.io/documentation/operators/backpressure.html)（backpressure）机制，不过它也没有起到作用。

## It must be a memory leak
## 一定是内存泄漏

At this point, a colleague who had kept a cooler head, suggested we do what we should have done in the first place, which is to look at what data we actually had in the heap. We set up a development instance with an amount of data comparable to the one in production and a proportionally scaled heap. By connecting to it with `jvisualvm` and running the memory sampler, we could see the approximate counts and sizes of objects in the heap. A quick look revealed that the number of our domain `Ad` objects was way larger than it should be and kept growing all the time during indexing, up to a number which bore a striking resemblance to the number of ads we were processing. But… this couldn’t be. After all, we were streaming the records using RX exactly for this reason: in order to avoid loading all of the data into memory.

这时，一个当时头脑还保持冷静的同事，建议我们应该做一开始就做的事情：检查堆中的数据。我们准备了一个开发环境的实例，拥有和线上实例相同的数据量，堆的大小也大致相同。把它连接到 `jnisualvm` ，分析内存的样本，我们可以看到堆中对象的大致数量和大小。大眼一看，可以发现我们域中`Ad`对象的数量高的不正常，并且在索引的过程中一直在增长，一直增长到我们处理的广告的数量级别。但是……这不应该啊。毕竟，我们通过 RX 把这些数据整理成流，就是为了防止把所有的数据都加载到内存里。

![Memory Sampler showed many more Ad objects than we expected](https://allegro.tech/img/articles/2018-02-09-a-comedy-of-errors-debugging-java-memory-leaks/memory-sampler-many-ad-objects.png)

With growing suspicion, I inspected the code, which had been written about two years before and never seriously revisited since. Lo and behold, we were actually loading all data into memory. It was, of course not intended. Not knowing RxJava well enough at that time, we wanted to parallelize the code in a particular way and resolved to using `CompletableFuture` along with a separate executor in order to offload some work from the main RX flow. But then, we had to wait for all the `CompletableFuture`s to complete… by storing references to them and calling `join()`. This caused the references to all futures, and thus also to all the data they referenced, to be kept alive until the end of indexing, and prevented the Garbage Collector from freeing them up earlier.

随着怀疑越来越强，我检查了这部分代码。它们是两年前写的，之后就没有再被仔细的检查过。果不其然，我们实际上把所有的数据都加载到了内存里。这当然不是故意的。由于当时对 RxJava 的理解不够全面，我们想让代码以一种特殊的方式并行运行。为了从 RX 的主工作流中剥离出来一些工作，我们决定用一个单独的 executor 跑 `CompetableFuture`。但是，我们因此就需要等待所有的 `CompetableFuture` 都工作完……通过存储他们的引用，然后调用 `join()`。这导致一直到索引完成，所有的 future 的引用，以及它们引用到的数据，都保持着生存的状态。这阻止了垃圾收集器及时的把它们清理掉。

## Is it really so bad?
## 真有这么糟糕吗？

This is obviously a stupid mistake, and we were quite disgusted at finding it so late. I even remembered a brief discussion a long time earlier about the app needing a 12 GB heap, which seemed a bit much. But on the other hand, this code had worked for almost two years without any issues. We were able to fix it with relative ease at this point while it would probably have taken us much more time if we tried fixing it two years before and at that time there was a lot of work much more important for the project than saving a few gigabytes of memory.

当然这是一个很愚蠢的错误，对于发现得这么晚，我们也很恶心。我甚至想起很久之前，关于这个应用需要 12 GB 的堆的问题，曾有个简短的讨论。12 GB 的堆，确实有点大了。但是另一方面，这些代码已经运行了将近两年了，没有发生过任何问题。我们可以在当时相对容易的修复它，然而如果是两年前，这可能需要我们花费更多的时间，而且相对于节省几个 G 的内存，当时我们有很多更重要的工作。

So while on a purely technical level having this issue for such a long time was a real shame, from a strategic point of view maybe leaving it alone despite the suspected inefficiency was the pragmatically wiser choice. Of course, yet another consideration was the impact of the problem once it came into light. We got away with almost no impact for the users, but it could have been worse. Software engineering is all about trade-offs, and deciding on the priorities of different tasks is no exception.

因此，虽然从纯技术的角度来说，这个问题如此长时间没解决确实很丢人，然而从战略性的角度来看，或许留着这个浪费内存的问题不管，是更务实的选择。当然，另一个考虑就是这个问题一旦发生，会造成什么影响。我们几乎没有对用户造成任何影响，不过结果有可能更糟糕。软件工程就是权衡利弊，决定不同任务的优先级也不例外。

## Still not working

## 还是不行

Having more RX experience under our belt, we were able to quite easily get rid of the `CompletableFuture`s, rewrite the code to use only RX, migrate to RX2 in the process, and to actually stream the data instead of collecting it in memory. The change passed code review and went to testing in dev environment. To our surprise, the app was still not able to perform indexing with a smaller heap. Memory sampling revealed that the number of ads kept in memory was smaller than previously and it not only grew but sometimes also decreased, so it was not all collected in memory. Still, it seemed as if the data was not being streamed, either.

有了更多使用 RX 的经验之后，我们可以很简单的解决 `ComplerableFurue` 的问题。重写代码，只使用 RX；在重写的过程中，升级到 RX2；真正的流式处理数据，而不是在内存里收集它们。这些改动通过 code review 之后，部署到开发环境进行测试。让我们吃惊的是，应用所需的内存丝毫没有减少。内存抽样显示，相较之前，内存中广告对象的数量有所减少。而且对象的数量现在不会一直增长，有时也会下降，因此他们不是全部在内存里收集的。还是老问题，看起来这些数据仍然没有真正的被归集成流。

## So what is it now?

## 那现在是怎么回事？

The relevant keyword was already used in this post: backpressure. When data is streamed, it is common for the speeds of the producer and the consumer to differ. If the producer is faster than the consumer and nothing forces it to slow down, it will keep producing more and more data which can not be consumed just as fast. There will appear a growing buffer of outstanding records waiting for consumption and this is exactly what happened in our application. Backpressure is the mechanism which allows a slow consumer to tell the fast producer to slow down.

相关的关键词刚才已经提到了：背压。当数据被流式处理，生产者和消费者的速度不同是很正常的。如果生产者比消费者快，并且不能把速度降下来，它就会一直生产越来越多的数据，消费者无法以同样的速度处理掉他们。现象就是未处理数据的缓存不断增长，而这就是我们应用中真正发生的。背压就是一套机制，它允许一个较慢的消费者告诉较快的生产者去降速。

Our indexing stream had no notion of backpressure which was not a problem as long as we were storing the whole index in memory anyway. Once we fixed one problem and started to actually stream the data, another problem — the lack of backpressure — became apparent.

我们的索引系统没有背压的概念，这在之前没什么问题，反正我们把整个索引都保存到内存里了。一旦我们解决了之前的问题，开始真正的流式处理数据，缺少背压的问题就变得很明显了。

This is a pattern I have seen multiple times when dealing with performance issues: fixing one problem reveals another which you were not even aware of because the other issue hid it from view. You may not be aware your house has a fire safety issue if it is regularly getting flooded.

这个模式我在解决性能问题时见过很多次了：解决一个问题时会浮现另一个你甚至没有听说过的问题，因为其他问题把它隐藏起来了。如果你的房子经常被淹，你不会注意到它有火灾隐患。

## Fixing the fix

## 修复由修复引起的问题

In RxJava 2, the original Observable class was split into `Observable` which does not support backpressure and `Flowable` which does. Fortunately, there are some neat ways of creating `Flowable`s which give them backpressure support out-of-the-box. This includes creating `Flowable`s from non-reactive sources such as `Iterable`s. Combining such `Flowable`s results in `Flowable`s which also support backpressure, so fixing just one spot quickly gave the whole stream backpressure support.

在 RxJava 2 里，原来的 Observable 类被拆成了不支持背压的 Observable 和支持背压的 Flowable。幸运的是，有一些简单的办法，可以开箱即用的把不支持背压的 Observable 改造成支持背压的 Flowable。其中包含从非响应式的资源比如 `Iterable` 创建 `Flowable`。把这些 `Flowable` 融合起来可以生成同样支持背压的 `Flowable`，因此只要快速解决一个点，整个系统就有了背压的支持。

With this change in place, we were able to reduce the heap from 12 GB to 3 GB and still have the app do its job just as fast as before. We still got a single full GC with a pause of roughly 2 seconds once every few hours, but this was already much better than the 20 second pauses (and crashes) we saw before.

有了这个改动之后，我们把堆从 12 GB 减少到了 3 GB ，同时让系统保持和之前同样的速度。我们仍然每隔数小时就会有一次暂停长达 2 秒的 full GC，不过这比我们之前见到的 20 秒的暂停（还有系统崩溃）要好多了。

## GC tuning again

## 再次优化 GC

However, the story was not over yet. Looking at GC logs, we still noticed lots of premature tenuring — on the order of 70%. Even though performance was already acceptable, we tried to get rid of this effect, hoping to perhaps also prevent the full garbage collection at the same time.

但是，故事到此还没有结束。检查 GC 的日志，我们注意到大量的过早提升，占到 70%。尽管性能已经可以接受了，我们也尝试去解决这个问题，希望也许可以同时解决 full GC 的问题。

![Lots of premature tenuring](https://allegro.tech/img/articles/2018-02-09-a-comedy-of-errors-debugging-java-memory-leaks/premature-tenuring-with-backpressure-added.png)

Premature tenuring (also known as premature promotion) happens when an object is short-lived but gets promoted to the old (tenured) generation anyway. Such objects may affect GC performance since they stuff up the old generation which is usually much larger and uses different GC algorithms than new generation. Therefore, premature promotion is something we want to avoid.

如果一个对象的生命周期很短，但是它仍然晋升到了老年代，我们就把这种现象叫做过早提升（premature tenuring）（或者叫过早升级）。老年代里的对象通常都比较大，使用与新生代不同的 GC 算法，而这些过早提升的对象占据了老年代的空间，所以它们会影响 GC 的性能。因此，我们想竭力避免过早提升。

We knew our app would produce lots of short-lived objects during indexing, so some premature promotion was no surprise, but its extent was. The first thing that comes to mind when dealing with an app that creates lots of short-lived objects is to simply increase the size of young generation. By default, G1GC can adjust the size of generations automatically, allowing for between 5% and 60% of the heap to be used by the new generation. I noticed that in the live app proportions of young and old generations changed all the time over a very wide range of proportions, but still went ahead and checked what would happen if I raised both bounds: `-XX:G1NewSizePercent=40` and `-XX:G1MaxNewSizePercent=90`. This did not help, and it actually made matters much worse, triggering full GCs almost immediately after the app started. I tried some other ratios, but the best I could arrive at was only increasing `G1MaxNewSizePercent` without modifying the minimum value: it worked about as well as defaults but not better.

我们的应用在索引的过程中会产生大量短生命周期的对象，因此一些过早提升是正常的，但是不应该如此严重。当应用产生大量短生命周期的对象时，能想到的第一件事就是简单的增加新生代的空间。默认情况下，G1 的 GC 可以自动的调整新生代的空间，允许新生代使用堆内存的 5% 至 60%。我注意到运行的应用里，新生代和老年代的比例一直在一个很宽的幅度里变化，不过我依然动手修改了两个参数：`-XX:G1NewSizePercent=40` 和 `-XX:G1MaxNewSizePercent=90`看看会发生什么。这没起作用，甚至让事情变得更糟糕了，应用一启动就触发了 full GC。我也尝试了其他的比例，不过最好的情况就是只增加 `G1MaxNewSizePercent`而不修改最小值。这起了作用，大概和默认值的表现差不多，也没有变好。

After trying a few other options, with as little success as in my first attempt, I gave up and e-mailed Kirk Pepperdine who is a renowned expert in Java performance and whom I had the opportunity to meet at Devoxx conference and during training sessions at Allegro. After viewing GC logs and exchanging a few e-mails, Kirk suggested an experiment which was to set `-XX:G1MixedGCLiveThresholdPercent=100`. This setting should force G1GC mixed collections to clean all old regions regardless of how much they were filled up, and thus to also remove any objects prematurely tenured from young. This should prevent old generation from filling up and causing a full GC at any point. However, we were again surprised to get a full garbage collection run after some time. Kirk concluded that this behavior, which he had seen earlier in other applications, was a bug in G1GC: the mixed collections were apparently not able to clean up all garbage and thus allowed it to accumulate until full GC. He said he had contacted Oracle about it but they claimed this was not a bug and the behavior we observed was correct.

尝试了很多办法后，也没有取得什么成就，我就放弃了，然后给 Kirk Pepperdine 发了封邮件。他是位很知名的 Java 性能专家，我碰巧在 Allegro 举办的 Devoxx 会议的训练课程里认识了他。通过查看 GC 的日志以及几封邮件的交流，Kirk 建议试试设置 `-XX:G1MixedGCLiveThresholdPercent=100`。这个设置应该会强制 G1 GC 在 mixed GC 时不去考虑它们被填充了多少，而是强制清理所有的老年代，因此也同时清理了从新生代过早提升的对象。这应该会阻止老年代被填满从而产生一次 full GC。然而，在运行一段时间以后，我们再次惊讶的发现了一次 full GC。Kirk 推断说他在其他应用里也见到过这种情况，它是 G1 GC 的一个 bug：mixed GC 显然没有清理所有的垃圾，让它们一直堆积直到产生 full GC。他说他已经把这个问题通知了 Oracle，不过他们坚称我们观察到的这个现象不是一个 bug，而是正常的。

## Conclusion

## 结论

What we ended up doing was just increasing the app’s heap size a bit (from 3 to 4 GB), and full garbage collections went away. We still see a lot of premature tenuring but since performance is OK now, we don’t care so much any more. One option we could try would be switching to CMS (Concurrent Mark Sweep) GC, but since it is deprecated by now, we’d rather avoid using it if possible.

我们最后做的就是把应用的内存调大了一点点（从 3 GB 到 4 GB），然后 full GC 就消失了。我们仍然观察到大量的过早提升，不过既然性能是没问题的，我们就不在乎这些了。一个我们可以尝试的选项是转换到 GMS（Concurrent Mark Sweep）GC，不过由于它已经被废弃了，我们还是尽量不去使用它。

![Problem fixed — GC pauses after all changes and 4 GB heap](https://allegro.tech/img/articles/2018-02-09-a-comedy-of-errors-debugging-java-memory-leaks/adventory-gc-pause-fixed-4-gb.png)

So what is the moral of the story? First, performance issues can easily lead you astray. What at first seemed to be a ZooKeeper or network issue, turned out to be an error in our own code. Even after realizing this, the first steps I undertook were not well thought out. I started tuning garbage collection in order to avoid full GC before checking in detail what was really going on. This is a common trap, so beware: even if you have an intuition of what to do, check your facts and check them again in order to not waste time solving a problem different from the one you are actually dealing with.

那么这个故事的寓意是什么呢？首先，性能问题很容易让你误入歧途。一开始看起来是 ZooKeeper 或者 网络的问题，最后发现是我们代码的问题。即使意识到了这一点，我首先采取的措施也没有考虑周全。为了防止 full GC，我在检查到底发生了什么之前就开始调优 GC。这是一个常见的陷阱，因此记住：即使你有一个直觉去做什么，先检查一下到底发生了什么，再检查一遍，防止浪费时间去错误的问题。

Second, getting performance right is really hard. Our code had good test coverage and feature-wise worked perfectly, but failed to meet performance requirements which were not clearly defined at the beginning and which did not surface until long after deployment. Since it is usually very hard to faithfully reproduce your production environment, you will often be forced to test performance in production, regardless of how bad that sounds.

第二条，性能问题太难解决了。我们的代码有良好的测试覆盖率，而且运行的特别好，但是它也没有满足性能的要求，它在开始的时候就没有清晰的定义好。性能问题直到部署之后很久才浮现出来。由于通常很难真实的再现你的生产环境，你经常被迫在生产环境测试性能，即使那听起来非常糟糕。

Third, fixing one issue may allow another, latent one, to surface, and force you to keep digging in for much longer than you expected. The fact that we had no backpressure was enough to break the app, but it didn’t become visible before we had fixed the memory leak.

第三条，解决一个问题有可能引发另一个潜在问题的浮现，强迫你不断挖的比你预想的更深。我们没有背压的事实足以中断这个系统，但是直到我们解决了内存泄漏的问题后，它才浮现。

I hope you find this funny experience of ours helpful when debugging your own performance issues!

我希望我们这个有趣的经历，能在你解决自己遇到的性能问题时发挥一些作用。
