There’s a lot going on in the developer world. No matter whether you’re a complete beginner or a seasoned expert, it just never seems to stop. Here are some ideas on how to handle it all.

开发人员的世界里总是忙个不停。无论你是全新的菜鸟，还是资深的专家，它似乎永无休止。下面是一些关于如何处理所有这些事情的想法。

I’ve done my best to make this article concise & skimmable, in the hope that it may be helpful without adding too much to the chaos. It’s divided up into 4 sections: Mindset, Learning, Social Pressure, and Toolset. Let’s go.

我已经尽力让这篇文章变得简练易读，希望它能带来帮助而不是进一步添乱。文章分为四部分：心态，学习，社会压力和工具。

## Mindset
It all starts in the mind. Feeling overwhelmed is a response to too much going on at once, being over-stimulated and unable to process everything. You need to refocus, and reprioritise.

## 心态
一切源自心态。感到压力山大是因为手头一次性要处理的事情积压太多，从而导致出现过激反应，进而无法处理任何事情。你需要重新调整重心和优先级。

**Understand the problem**

**理解问题所在**

This is the first step of any problem-solving technique. **Why is it you feel overwhelmed?** What’s the root cause? Is it too much to learn? Too much to keep up with? Too much responsibility at work? Peer pressure? Too many expectations of yourself?

这是任何解决问题技巧的第一步。**你为何觉得压力山大？** 问题的根源在哪里？同时要跟进的事情太多？工作责任太大？还是来自同辈的压力或者自我期望过高？

It can help to sit down with a pen & paper and map out the problems you’re dealing with. It will help you to find your biggest issues, so you know what you need to learn to handle the most.
